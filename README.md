# Portfolio: Showcasing Skills and Experience

I graduated as a software developer in 2022 and as I embarked on the journey to find my first job opportunity I recognized the importance of establishing a strong online presence. To achieve this, I created a portfolio project that not only exhibits my skills and experience but also demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and growth.

## Project Overview

The portfolio project I developed is a testament to my proficiency in various technologies and my ability to create visually simple, beautifull and informative web applications.

Leveraging the power of React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and CSS, I have crafted a dynamic and engaging portfolio that effectively communicates my capabilities and achievements.

## Key Features

### React

Being a firm believer in the power and versatility of React, I made it my go-to framework for this project.

### TypeScript

This project served as an excellent playground for me to hone my TypeScript skills. By incorporating static typing throughout the codebase, I gained numerous advantages in terms of bug detection and overall code quality.

### Bootstrap

Leveraging the power of Bootstrap, I was able to create a responsive and mobile-friendly design and reduce the amount of CSS.

### CSS

The project features two themes - dark and light theme. To implement these, I utilized CSS variables, which allowed me to easily and efficiently modify the color palette and other visual elements across the entire project. The use of CSS variables also allows for easy customization and further theming in the future.

### Animation

To enhance user engagement, I incorporated animations using the react-animation-on-scroll package.

### Localization

Recognizing that most work places use english as they work language, I wanted to make the portfolio in two languages. I integrated English and Finnish translations into my portfolio using the i18next library.
